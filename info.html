                    <h3>The Science Behind Our Changing Climate</h3>
                    <p>Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While climate variations are natural, scientific evidence shows that human activities have been the main driver of climate change since the mid-20th century.</p>
                    
                    <h3>The Greenhouse Effect</h3>
                    <p>Our atmosphere acts like a blanket around Earth. When we burn fossil fuels (coal, oil, gas), we release greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These gases trap heat from the sun, causing global temperatures to rise - a process called the greenhouse effect.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why Should Teens Care?</h3>
                    <p>Climate change affects everything from the air we breathe to the food we eat. Rising temperatures lead to more extreme weather events, sea level rise, and ecosystem disruption. As the generation that will inherit this planet, understanding climate change is crucial for our future.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>🔥 Burning Fossil Fuels</h3>
                        <p>Coal, oil, and natural gas power our cars, homes, and industries. When burned, they release carbon dioxide - the main greenhouse gas driving climate change.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>🌲 Deforestation</h3>
                        <p>Trees absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. When forests are cut down, we lose these natural carbon sinks and release stored carbon back into the air.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>🏭 Industrial Activities</h3>
                        <p>Manufacturing, agriculture, and other industries produce greenhouse gases through energy use, chemical processes, and waste management.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>🚗 Transportation</h3>
                        <p>Cars, trucks, planes, and ships burn fossil fuels, contributing significantly to global emissions. Transportation accounts for about 14% of global greenhouse gas emissions.</p>

                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>🏠 Energy Use</h3>
                        <p>Heating, cooling, and powering our homes and buildings requires energy, much of which comes from burning fossil fuels.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="card">
                        <h3>🍖 Agriculture & Food</h3>
                        <p>Livestock farming, especially cattle, produces methane. Food production, processing, and transportation also contribute to emissions.</p>

                <h2 class="section-title">How Climate Change Affects Us</h2>
                <div class="card">
                    <h3>🌡️ Rising Temperatures</h3>
                    <p>Global average temperatures have increased by about 1.1°C since the late 1800s. This might not sound like much, but it's causing significant changes to our climate system.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🌊 Sea Level Rise</h3>
                    <p>As temperatures rise, ice sheets and glaciers melt, and ocean water expands. Sea levels have risen about 8 inches since 1900, threatening coastal communities worldwide.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🌪️ Extreme Weather</h3>
                    <p>Climate change is making extreme weather events more frequent and intense. We're seeing more powerful hurricanes, longer droughts, heavier rainfall, and more intense heatwaves.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🌍 Ecosystem Disruption</h3>
                    <p>Plants and animals are struggling to adapt to rapidly changing conditions. Many species are moving to new areas or facing extinction as their habitats change.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🌾 Food Security</h3>
                    <p>Changes in temperature and rainfall patterns affect crop yields. Some regions may become too hot or dry for farming, while others may face flooding.</p>
                    
                    <h3>🏥 Health Impacts</h3>
                    <p>Climate change affects human health through heat stress, air pollution, increased disease transmission, and mental health impacts from extreme weather events.</p>
