                    <h3>Born from Passion and Purpose</h3>
                    <p>Youth For Earth was founded by a group of passionate teenagers who realized that climate change isn't just a problem for adults to solve - it's our future at stake. We started as a small group of friends concerned about the environment, and we've grown into a global movement of young people taking action for our planet.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Why We Started</h3>
                    <p>We noticed that while climate change information was available, it wasn't always accessible or engaging for teenagers. We wanted to create a platform where young people could learn about climate change in a way that made sense to us, connect with others who shared our concerns, and take meaningful action in our communities.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Our Vision</h3>
                    <p>We envision a world where every young person understands their role in addressing climate change and feels empowered to take action. We believe that by educating, connecting, and activating teens worldwide, we can create a powerful force for positive environmental change.</p>
